For winning the competition, the shirt was sold on Bloomingdales.com and 50% of the proceeds as well as an additional one thousand dollars were donated to our national philanthropy, Reading is Fundamental.</a></h7>

                    	<h7>This series of images represents my inability to communicate due to a fear of confrontation. I fear confrontation because of how I observed its affect on the people around me while I was growing up and I never wanted to put that same negative toll on my own relationships. As I grew up I began to notice how my quiet, non-confrontational personality was isolating me from society because I found it was easier to keep my feelings to myself than to talk to them about them. These images all contain an object that is coated with a sticky, gross substance. This coating represents its separation from society as well as a defect in its existence.</h7>
